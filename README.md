Exploring Open AI APIs with Flutter

## Introduction

This project is used to explore OpenAI ChatGPT3 powering Lanugage Models in Dart and Flutter.

Mainly, I am exploring the Completion Endpoint to ask the AI suggestions for criteria & choices related to any Decisions.
All available 4 Lanugage Models are requested for prompt for comparison to see which model is best to use.
The exploration is for another app [https://www.decisionmentor.app](DecisionMentor).

## Getting Started
Get Started by using your OpenAI API Key in `openai_helper.dart` file for variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
Then simply `flutter run`.
